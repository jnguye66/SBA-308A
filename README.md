DESCRIPTION:

This is my project for SBA 308A: JavaScript Web Application. It is written in Javascript and is run through Port 5500.
When running the project, the user will be prompted a webpage that allows them to search up any Pokemon card, and then have it 
displayed to them with a little portion of information about the card. 
The output is a form that takes information from the TCGdex API, including a picture example of the card, and then information
about the card like the Pokemon's name, typing, health points, and even the illustrator that made the art.
